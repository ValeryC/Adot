# Adot Inteview

Goal: Evaluate skill with React, Typescript and css with 2 models

Create a React App that can display card of destination
Create a button that can display a modal
App should have a unit test with @testing-library/react

### `Details`

Use React context to save and get new destination.
Context should use a custom hook to store and get destination in localStorage.
"Toggle" on card destination can be active/inactive even without effect
Adress should be focus at the opening of the modal
Modal should close at validation or with a click outside of the modal or escape   

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start or yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test or yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
