# Adot Inteview

Goal: Evaluate skill with React, Typescript and css with 2 models

Create a React App that can display card of destination
Create a button that can display a modal
App should have a unit test with @testing-library/react

### `Details`

Context should use a custom hook to store and get destination in localStorage.
"Toggle" on card destination can be active/inactive even without effect
Adress should be focus at the opening of the modal
Modal should close at validation or with a click outside of the modal or escape
